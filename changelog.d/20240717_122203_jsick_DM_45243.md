### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Upgrade to Pydantic version 2. With this new Pydantic version, the custom Orcid and Ror types in the DocumentMetadata model are now implemented as functional validators with annotations.

- Python version compatibility is now Python 3.11 and later.

- Theme plugins are now required to implement a `run_post_build` method that post-processes the Lander site build. This method can be a no-op.

### New features

- Lander uses importlib to discover and load plugins, rather than `pkg_resources`.

### Other changes

- Lander is now linted and formatted with ruff.

\section{Studies to date}
We have demonstrated some of the major components of \gls{LSST} \gls{Data Management} work well on Google  \citedsp{DMTN-072}.

We deployed \gls{Qserv} on Google with reasonable performance.
We demonstrated Data transfer  could adequate for \gls{Prompt Processing}, within the limits of the available network.
The Prompt Product Database was  stood up and tested.  The  \gls{Science Platform} was deployed and users simulated.
The later of course is designed around kubernetes and made for Google Cloud.

A detailed report may be found in \citeds{DMTN-125}.

We have not considered bulk transfer of data to other partners - Google may be much better placed to do this than any computing centre.

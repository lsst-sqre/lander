\section{LSST compute and storage needs}

The greatest cost driver is storage - we accumulate about 50PB a year of data. All of this needs to be processed annually. Hence in year 10 we need to access about half an Exabyte of data. Not all of this will be regularly accessed, it is likely few of the raw images will be reprocessed by individual astronomers.

\tabref{tab:Inputs} gives a rough overview of compute and storage needs.
